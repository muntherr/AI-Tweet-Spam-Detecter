---2eJpQ2HAnRQRp2v7XLA,#NAME?,i came to Chicago on business and was initially supposed to stay downtown; however a colleague recommended this hotel--and I am so glad that they did! The attention to detail and finishing touches in my room are what made this hotel feel like home. Staying in a smaller hotel allowed me to connect with the local Chicago vibe while simultaneously enjoying exquisite service from the staff at a fraction of what it might cost to stay in a Magnificent Mile high-rise. Considering the quality ambiance and charm of this hidden Chicago treasure it made my trip a memorable experience. Not only was I able to secure a bike rental to avoid the high cost of renting a car but I also was directed to some of the local galleries in the West Loop by the friendly staff members.,5,5,9/28/2011,0,2,0

--87QVdPvgbDK3GeVxFRzg,92rtlWxS2aOngzkKhi-OxQ,My family has been using Korean Air for many many years now. Going to Asia Korean Air is one of the lowest priced airlines and yet their service is not compromised. The flight attendants are lovely professional and polite. Check in is good and the meals served are also good. The only thing is that if you have to speak with their customer service line it's quite hard to communicate with their staff. Luckily I have some Korean friends and they have done the talking for us otherwise it couldve been worse. All their baggage policies are the standard international size and weight limitations. I suggest not only with this airline but with all airlines to familiarize yourself with their change cancellation and baggage policies before you commit. Airlines will serve the food their country,4,0,7/28/2012,43,158,0
--99ZJoVHP32iSd4i4nlZw,Egu4qSFR56EhGuTHZTaVjA,I hadn't been to Grisanti's since a pre-homecoming dinner in high school so I had no idea what to expect.  But since I had watched a cooking show that involved homemade ravioli last night that's what I had my heart set on when we arrived.  I figured... Italian Restaurant has to have ravioli right? Well long story short they didn't (except for the fried appetizer kind) and I settled for spinach and chicken manicotti.  But before I got to that I indulged in copious amounts of the complementary never-ending butter-injected bread with marinara sauce.  Then I opted for a cup of 'roasted onion soup' in lieu of salad (but had salad also since everyone else at the table ordered it and it was served family style).   The soup (which I guess they don't want to call 'French Onion' since that woul,3,0,1/28/2010,133,725,0
#NAME?,6PEIKIibsT3NkG1THRfJPg,I have eyed this shop at the Old orchard location and was thrilled to have time to wander into the Evanston shop. First off- let me say the the you girl who was working (short reddish hair glasses and piercings) was incredibly friendly and helpful.  My mother and I were in the shop close to closing time but that did not deter her from grabbing other merchandise to show us and really helping us!  She was ab Fab. The pricing is incredibly cheap.  I picked up a cape/sweater thing for the office for 38$.  My mother picked up a great sweater to throw on to go shopping etc for the same price. I mean really.  38$?   The selection of gifts and cards is really cute.  I am a fan of this place!,4,1,11/20/2011,86,478,0
#NAME?,7dwh3pL2tbSeSvL0qLzUrw,The highlight is the unique menu. The assorted pancakes waffles and other breakfast goodness make it a great breakfast choice. The portions are generous the ingredients are fresh and the flavors are wonderful! The service and atmosphere are also both amazing. The one downside is that they really back you in here when they are busy but business is business!,4,1,6/17/2011,24,461,1
--C-lbQ1ewqAO2UGhk0Xlw,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,So this was my first Yelp outing... I arrived right around 7:30 pm - a few others were there before me - we had to stand outside for a few minutes - which did not bother me. We had a little room in the back to ourselves. Before ordering we had to negotiate with our server about the fact that several of us needed to have separate checks as we were paying with credit cards - our server tried to make this into a difficult task - but in the end we got what we wanted. I eagerly looked over the menu since I had heard good things about this place. I was disappointed to see that there was no Poki offering on the menu. So I asked anyway - no no Poki. So then I ordered Miso soup Edamame and a variety of rolls and Nigiri sashimi. First I was informed that they were out of Edamame then out of sc,3,4,11/18/2007,1388,2530,0
#NAME?,OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,Not having a sweet tooth not being a non-cupcake aficionado I love Yelp for pointing out little gems like the Hummingbird Bakery. Am I right in saying that cupcakes are an American obsession which is slowly translating itself across the Atlantic and in years to come just like the indigenous red squirrels of today we'll be creating special protected areas to try to stop the humble English custard tart from being wiped out by its more aggressive American cake cousin? From the outside the cute arrangement of the different coloured tarts in the window display made me think it was an art gallery until the words Hummingbird Bakery over the shop triggered the latent Yelp memories. So I told my friend confidently that this was the best cupcake in town according to my knowledgeable Yelp friends,4,2,5/31/2009,754,1693,0
#NAME?,jO44Apni7iJZVVK4HQ60tA,Ok the wait this time was decent despite a packed house.  I went at 12:45 so perhaps that made the difference.  Back to 3 stars. We split a dragon roll  a spicy salmon roll and a crab salad roll.  So sue us we were hungry.   The eel on the dragon roll was really good this time-- fresh and moist.  The salmon was fantastic-- really fresh high quality vibrant and buttery.  Points for drsssing the salmon so it lacked any of those tough stringy things.  You know what I'm talking about.  Those things completely ruin a bite of sushi for me.  The edamame were slightly overcooked.  Like I said we were hungry.   If the quality remains this high consistently they will remain in my good graces.  And isn't that what everyone wants?,3,0,Update - 12/11/2008,34,166,0
#NAME?,IXUeKSqli1tW-I-0utd9KA,My sisters told me at a very young age that when buying a girl a gift you can never go wrong with things that come in little blue boxes. I took that advice to heart and have been making girls happy as I can be ever since. If you know me then you know that if you are dating me around your birthday valentines day or christmas your going to get hooked up with some Tiffany's bling You can ask all my ex's even the ones that hate me they will tell you they have made out especially at Christmas. This year is no exception except I have no one girl to buy a buying a bunch of presents. So I am buying a bunch of gifts for a couple of special girls. Usually I make three or four trips during the holidays and today was trip number one of  many to pick up a few things. There are all kinds of grea,5,1,12/8/2011,6,51,0
#NAME?,3zxy3LVBV3ttxoYbY4rQ8A,If you think being past out in the backseat of a cab is proof of a kick-ass night well you're wrong. To end the night with a bang you MUST go to Mai's Restaurant for a late night snack (read: feast). It's also a good choice for lunch/casual dinner. Entrees are served family-style (big plates serving spoon) so sharing is encouraged. Top picks: Start off with spring rolls served with mounds of fresh greens (you'll need that extra hydration boozehounds); Vietnamese egg rolls steaming hot crispy goodness with a side of jalepeno-adorned fish sauce; garlic beef (or chicken) infused with soppy sauce veggies and piles of fully-cooked and soft garlic cloves--almost as savory as the meat--and of course fried rice. For the faithful Tex-Mex fan they event have a Vietnamese carne gisada. Yo,4,7,5/13/2008,151,1011,1
#NAME?,G0FGeAGBj7IUFgCidXaSqg,I loved Daytons. I was peeved about Fields. I was totally bummed with Macy's. In general this place is crap BUT it is the only place in MN to get the Thomas Pink Shirts and for that reason alone I must support it. What can I say I'm a sucker for my hubby in PINK.,3,5,9/6/2008,137,548,0
#NAME?,XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,BJ's recently opened a location over in Virginia Gateway in Gainesville VA. I received an invitation in the mail for a two month trial membership - so I went in to check it out. I had the option of signing up for a year beyond the 2 month trial membership for $40.00. If I waited for the 2 month trial membership to expire and then make a decision on membership - at that point the price would be $50.00 for a year. So I went ahead and signed up for the year - which means I have 14 months for $40.00. Because the place is so new the place looks nice and clean. I went and stocked up on things like bottled water dishwasher detergent and dishwasher drying agent. The one thing I will ding them on is their Membership Services area seemed a little disorganized. There were five people behind the c,4,2,3/25/2012,1388,2530,0

These were some of the most incredible donuts ever...beats anything else in the state hands down.,5,1,10/24/2010,45,306,0
